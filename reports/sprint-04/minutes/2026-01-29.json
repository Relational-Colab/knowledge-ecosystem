  "discussion": [
    {
      "topic": "Batch-mode standup update failure",
      "details": "The batch-mode validator and update workflow failed repeatedly despite correct contributor input. Investigation showed that the current design cannot reliably simulate multi-step transitions and is sensitive to newline and parsing artifacts. This mirrors the earlier GitHub workflow disruption and indicates a structural substrate issue rather than a contributor error."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Impact on ceremony",
      "details": "The failure disrupted standup cadence and created ceremony friction. To preserve governance integrity, automated updates were paused and the standup proceeded manually."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Substrate alignment decision",
      "details": "A structural redesign is required. Governance workflows will adopt an event-sourced architecture using JSONL as the canonical event log and SQLite as the projection engine, aligning with MLflow’s existing substrate. This provides transactional safety, auditability, and a unified foundation for governance and analytics workflows."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Scope for implementation",
      "details": "The redesign will be implemented within existing sprint scope via Issue S04.I03 and Task S04.I03.T01. No new issues are required at this time."
    },
    {
      "topic": "Manual updates applied",
      "details": "All intended transitions for S04.I02 tasks and S04.I03.T01 were applied manually to issues.jsonl and tasks.jsonl. The data layer is now consistent and validated."
    }
  ],
  "decisions": [
    {
      "decision": "Pause automated standup updates",
      "reason": "Validator and batch-mode workflow are structurally unreliable and require redesign."
    },
    {
      "decision": "Proceed with manual updates for this standup",
      "reason": "Ensures ceremony continuity and data integrity while automation is paused."
    },
    {
      "decision": "Adopt event-sourced + SQLite substrate",
      "reason": "Aligns governance workflows with MLflow, improves auditability, and removes ceremony fragility."
    },
    {
      "decision": "Delegate redesign to S04.I03 and S04.I03.T01",
