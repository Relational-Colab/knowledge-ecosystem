# Sprint 01 Retrospective
Date Range: Monday 5 January 2026 – Sunday 11 January 2026
Cadence: 1‑week sprint (aligned with Operating Model)
Bursts Completed: 28
Status: DONE

## 1. Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational operating model, governance structures, and initial production capability for the knowledge ecosystem. Validate the weekly cadence, complete the first ingestion batch, and reach a strategic inflection point where the system transitions from development into operations.

## 2. Summary of Achievements
### A. Operating Model Finalized
A complete, governance‑grade frameworks/operating-model.md was drafted, refined, and finalized.
It now defines:
* weekly Takt cadence
* flow structure
* constraint management
* batch governance
* ingestion discipline
* multi‑sprint research logic
* governance benefits
* scope boundaries

This is now the backbone of the ecosystem.

### B. Factory–Lab–Project Analogy Established
A powerful conceptual model was articulated:

Factory → weekly research → batch → ingestion

Projects → domain and capability expansion

Lab → experimentation using MLOps

This analogy will guide future contributors and governance decisions.

### C. DevOps–MLOps Integration Clarified
Sprint 01 produced a clear understanding of:
* DevOps for operational releases
* MLOps for experimentation and research
* how both align with the weekly cadence
* how research outputs integrate into operations and teaching

This sets the stage for Sprint 02’s research‑operationalization work.

### D. Documentation Hygiene Established
Document hygiene became a first‑class activity.
The operating model was refined through multiple iterations, establishing:
* formatting conventions
* clarity standards
* contributor‑readiness expectations

### E. Strategic Inflection Point Reached
The ecosystem transitioned from:

development → operations,

with the first batch completed and the production pipeline validated.

This marks the beginning of the ecosystem’s operational era.

## 3. Telemetry (Sprint 01)
Metric	Value	Notes
Bursts completed	28	Final burst clinched the sprint
Framework documents updated	1 major	operating-model.md
New conceptual frameworks	2	Factory–Lab–Project model; DevOps–MLOps integration
Ingestion batches	1	First operational batch completed
Documentation hygiene cycles	Multiple	Formatting, structure, clarity
Research alignment	Initiated	Prepared for Sprint 02 research operationalization
This telemetry will expand in future sprints (e.g., experiment counts, glossary growth, ingestion volume).

## 4. What Went Well
* Architectural clarity emerged rapidly
* Operating model reached governance‑grade maturity
* Documentation hygiene was strong and consistent
* The factory–lab–project analogy unlocked strategic insight
* Cadence discipline held steady
* The ecosystem reached a stable operational state

## 5. What Could Be Improved
* Earlier separation of project vs operations vs research lenses
* More explicit tracking of research outputs (to be addressed with MLOps)
* Need for a dedicated Research Operating Model

## 6. Changes for Sprint 02
* Introduce research-operating-model.md
* Stand up the lab with MLOps experiment tracking
* Begin the Digital Ethics domain project
* Create templates for research projects and experiment logs
* Align research sprints with weekly cadence

## 8. Strategic Position at Sprint Close
Sprint 01 ends with the ecosystem:
* operational
* governed
* documented
* cadence‑aligned
* ready for research operationalization
* prepared for domain expansion (Digital Ethics)

This sprint marks the transition from building the system to running the system.

## 9. Sprint 01 Definition of Done
* Operating model finalized
* First ingestion batch completed
* Governance structures established
* Documentation hygiene applied
* Strategic inflection point reached

Sprint 01 issue ready to close

Sprint 01 is complete.
