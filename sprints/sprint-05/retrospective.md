# Sprint 05 Retrospective

Sprint 05 reached a stable, governance‑aligned close with all planned work either completed or consciously deferred. The sprint maintained cadence integrity, respected the Sunday–Monday boundary, and preserved sovereignty over scope and flow. The governance substrate was significantly clarified, with major conceptual breakthroughs in node–edge distinctions, reflective‑note semantics, and the emerging governance graph.

## What Was Achieved
* Consolidated and renamed the governance substrate, removing duplication and aligning directory structure with doctrine.  
* Completed the migration of governance‑doctrine.md into its canonical location.  
* Removed obsolete pages/ directory and resolved all doctrine duplication.  
* Established the four‑layer governance model: doctrine, processes, schema, reflective notes.  
* Formalized the concept of reflective notes as edge containers.  
* Mapped Sprint 04 and MLflow validation notes into explicit graph bundles.  
* Clarified the operable definition of node‑ness, identity, durability, and event semantics.  
* Prepared the governance/ directory for subdirectory structuring in Sprint 06.  

## What Was Deferred
* Creation of governance/ subdirectories (doctrine/, processes/, schema/, notes/).  
* Generation of a governance‑graph README.  
* Full mapping of all governance artifacts into node and edge schemas.  
* Integration of governance graph concepts into the learning substrate.  
* All deferrals were intentional and aligned with constraint‑based governance.  
* State of the System  
* Cadence preserved
* Constraint stable and visible

### Substrate is clean and ready for Sprint 06 initiation.

### No open governance debt requiring emergency carry‑over.

## Boundary Check
* All files staged and committed.  
* No untracked or stray artifacts.  
* No pending migrations.  
* Sprint narrative complete.  

## Closing Statement
Sprint 05 ends cleanly at the boundary. The system is stable, doctrine‑aligned, and ready for Sprint 06 initiation.
The design of Sprint 06 must include the learning that I need, as indicated with the prepared learn/ directory and its subdirectories. This learning is scope for the sprints and must be included in Sprint 06, and sprints going forward.
