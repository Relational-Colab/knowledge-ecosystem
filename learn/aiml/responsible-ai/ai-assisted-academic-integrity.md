# AI-Assisted Academic Work and Academic Integrity
A Digital Ethics Domain Artifact (Seed Version)

## Purpose
This note articulates a transparent, academically defensible stance on the ethical use of AI tools (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) in academic work. It is grounded in peer‑reviewed and institutional guidance and is intended to evolve as policies, literature, and my own practice develop.

## Position Statement
Using AI tools in academic work is not inherently dishonest. Academic integrity depends on:
* Transparency about how AI was used  
* Proper attribution using APA 7th‑edition formats  
* Alignment with institutional and course policies  
* Human oversight, verification, and intellectual contribution  
* Preservation of learning outcomes  

This position is consistent with APA Style guidance, which emphasizes transparency and disclosure when AI tools contribute to academic writing. It is also aligned with university‑level academic integrity frameworks that require clear acknowledgement of AI assistance (Westcliff University Writing Center).

## Support from Authoritative Sources
**APA Style Blog (2025)**
APA explicitly states that generative AI tools may be used ethically in academic writing when their use is disclosed and cited. The APA Style team emphasizes that AI is an emerging technology requiring explicit acknowledgement, unlike common software.

**Westcliff University Writing Center (2025)**
Westcliff’s guidance reinforces that AI use is ethical when it is transparent, cited when quoted or paraphrased, and acknowledged when used for brainstorming or structural assistance.

**Grammarly’s APA Summary (2023)**
Grammarly’s APA guidance aligns with APA Style Blog recommendations: AI-generated text should be cited as algorithmic output, with the company as author and the date of access as the year.

Together, these sources support the academically defensible position that AI use does not violate academic integrity when properly cited, acknowledged, and aligned with policy.

## Conditions for Ethical AI Use in Academic Work:  
1. Transparency  
I will clearly state when and how AI tools contributed to my work.  

2. Attribution and Referencing  
When AI-generated text is quoted or paraphrased, I will include a full APA reference and in‑text citation.  

3. Policy Alignment  
I will follow the specific rules of each course and assignment.  

4. Human Oversight  
I remain responsible for verifying accuracy, coherence, and truthfulness.  

5. Preservation of Learning  
AI will support—not replace—my own reasoning and understanding.
